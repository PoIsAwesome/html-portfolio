<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I am 21 years old. I am a military kid and have moved around tons of times. When growing up I have always wanted to a pilot of somesort, I was so facinated with fighter jets my whole life.
    I enjoy playing games during my free time, flying planes, and especially working on my individual skills as a web developer. I enjoy mostly 
    FPS games like valorant and Rainbow Six Seige. I played soccer when I was little little, but ended up getting into ice hockey and played that for over 12 years.
    After high school I went to DMACC for my associates in telecommunications, and at the same time slowly started to get my private pilots license. I am looking to become a web designer and soon and hopefully become a contract pilot.
